# Memory Organize

Use `memory/` as the memory root.

## Workflow

1. Inspect notes in `memory/00_Inbox`.
2. Propose target folder for each note:
   - `10_Growth`
   - `20_Connections`
   - `30_Wealth`
   - `40_ProductMind`
3. Show a move plan first (source -> destination + reason).
4. Apply moves only after explicit confirmation.
5. Report final moved files.

## Rules

- Keep `00_Inbox` as intake area; do not bypass it.
- Preserve content and frontmatter during moves.
- If uncertain, keep note in inbox and mark as `needs_review`.
