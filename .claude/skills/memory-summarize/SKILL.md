# Memory Summarize

Use `memory/` as the memory root.

## Workflow

1. Collect relevant files under `memory/` (`.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`).
2. Read enough content to answer the user request accurately.
3. Produce a structured summary:
   - Key themes
   - Important facts/signals
   - Open questions or missing data
4. Cite the source paths used.

## Rules

- Do not claim lack of access before checking `memory/`.
- Prefer concise bullets over long prose.
- Separate facts from inferences.
